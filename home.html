        Welcome to the site of Isla: F&B Tools. We are here to provide the
        best and most affordable tools for the small restaurants of Puerto
        Rico. We recognize that it isn't always affordable to depend on modern
        digital tools, and is especially difficult to train managers in how to
        use them.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's our goal to provide the templates necessary to get you started.
        Leave the build and design to us. Explore our site for the variety of
        products we have and do not be afraid to
        <a href="contact-us">contact us</a> in case you have any questions. We
        take any and all feedback very seriously. In an industry as ever
        changing as food service it's important to be as flxible as designers
        as we can.
